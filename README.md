# Snake in PyGame

## What is purpose of this script
My first mini project consisting of several files. I know that some parts can be hard to read, but for the first time it's not too bad and in the end it works

## What it can do
Just simple snake game. Click on the setting value to change it. To change the name, first click on it (the cursor will not appear), write the name and press enter. To play just click on 'Play!'.
